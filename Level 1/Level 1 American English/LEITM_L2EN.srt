Welcome to EnglishClass101.com's "English in Three Minutes". 

1
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:17,007
The fastest, easiest, and most fun way to learn English.

2
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,005
Hey everyone, I'm Alisha!

3
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,013
In this series,

4
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:26,007
we're going to learn some easy ways to ask and answer common questions in English.

5
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:31,009
It's really useful, and it only takes three minutes!

6
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:37,016
In this lesson, you're going to learn how to ask what someone's job is in natural English.

7
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:41,279
Of course, you can just say, "What is your job?"

8
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:45,076
This is correct English, but it sounds too direct and awkward.

9
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:50,046
Native English speakers almost never say this in a social situation.

10
00:00:50,046 --> 00:00:53,033
Instead, they use a different question.

11
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,009
But before we master that, 

12
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,048
we need to compare it to a very similar question.

13
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,000
"What are you doing?"

14
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,009
"I'm presenting a video about English!"

15
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,066
"What do you do?"

16
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:07,082
"I'm an English teacher!"

17
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:10,031
Do you see the difference?

18
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,091
These two questions

19
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:18,619
"What are you doing?" and "What do you do?" sound similar, but mean different things.

20
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:25,076
The first one is asking what you are doing right now, this minute. 

21
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:27,024
You answer it using an -ing verb.

22
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:28,062
"What are you doing?"

23
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,088
"I'm reading!"

24
00:01:30,088 --> 00:01:32,486
"I'm watching TV!"

25
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:37,093
While the second is actually a shortened version of "What do you do for a living?".

26
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:42,035
This is how we ask "What is your job?" in natural English.

27
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,033
Let's practice this question.

28
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,092
"What do you do?"

29
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,006
(slowly) "What do you do?"

30
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:51,026
When native speakers of English ask this question,

31
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:56,200
it can come out very fast, and sound more like "Whadd'yado?"

32
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,539
In order to tell it apart from "what are you doing?", 

33
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,699
just listen for the "ing" sound on the end of the question

34
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,219
if it's not there, 

35
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,086
then you're being asked what your job is!

36
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,084
So how would you answer this question?

37
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:15,092
Just think of it as if the other person is asking you "What is your job?"

38
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,379
You could answer with "I am", plus your job.

39
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,088
"I'm a teacher."

40
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,619
(slow) I'm a teacher

41
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:26,014
or, I'm an engineer

42
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:33,067

and include a picture and audio to help you perfect your pronunciation.

45
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:45,011
You can also mention the place that you work at, 

46
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,005
starting with "I work at".

47
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:50,004
I work at a hospital.

48
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:51,094
(slow) I work at a hospital.

49
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,016
I work at a law firm.

50
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,082
(slow) I work at a law firm.

51
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:01,032
If you work for a big company that is well-known, 

52
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,066
you can say "I work for",

53
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:07,005
and then the name: "I work for Microsoft."

54
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,094
(slow) I work for Microsoft.

55
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:12,086
I work for The New York Times.

56
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,599
(slow) I work for The New York Times.

57
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,002
Now it's time for Alisha's Advice!

58
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,058
When you ask the question "What do you do?"

59
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:25,024
and the other person tells you their job, 

60
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:30,034
it's polite to make some kind of positive comment about his or her job

61
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,052
for example,

62
00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:38,798
"How interesting!" or "That must be exciting" or even "Oh, really!".

63
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:40,036
Remember to sound sincere!

64
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:46,008
Do you know how native English speakers ask each other what their hobbies are?

65
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:49,994
Hint: we don't use the word "hobbies"!

66
