Hey everyone, I'm Alisha!

3
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:20,022
In this series, 

4
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:24,088
we're going to learn some easy ways to ask and answer common questions in English.

5
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,006
It's really useful, 

6
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,004
and it only takes three minutes!

7
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:29,004
In this lesson, 

8
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,086
you're going to learn how to ask and say where you live.

9
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:37,066
Usually, someone will ask you where you live as a polite question 

10
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:39,062
after they've asked you your name, where you're from, 

11
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:41,032
and what you do for a living.

12
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:42,000
They'll say:

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,279
"So where do you live?"

14
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,054
This is inviting you to keep making conversation.

15
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:50,012
There are lots of ways you could answer this question, 

16
00:00:50,012 --> 00:00:52,018
but here's some of the most common.

17
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,018
You could say:

18
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,018
"Do you know...?

19
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:56,008
and then the name of the area you live in.

20
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:58,058
"Do you know Twin Pines?"

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,074
Or, you could mention a local landmark.

22
00:01:01,074 --> 00:01:03,008
Like: "Near the library."

23
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,619
"Near the movie theater."

24
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:09,048
You could also answer by telling the person what train line you live on,

25
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,003
if your city has a train network.

26
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:13,084
Or what station is the nearest to your house.

27
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:15,084
"On the Green Line."

28
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,074
"Near Central Station."

29
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:19,036
So as you can see, 

30
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:23,500
there are lots of possible ways to answer the question "Where do you live?"

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,028
Once you've told them, 

32
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:28,038
the other person might respond in one of the following ways:

33
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:30,036
"Oh, yeah, I know it!"

34
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,094
"I live near there!"

35
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:34,056
Or maybe: "I'm afraid I don't know it."

36
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,078
The other person is just being polite by showing interest, 

37
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,032
so you can reply by saying something like "Oh, really?"

38
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:45,018
Since the other person is asking you this question to be polite,

39
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:50,008
a good way to continue the conversation is to ask them the same question in return.

40
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:53,042
You can just say: "How about you?"

41
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:55,052
Or: "Where do you live?"

42
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:57,086
Put some stress on the you:

43
00:01:57,086 --> 00:01:59,058
"Where do you live?"

44
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:02,042
Now it's time for Alisha's Advice!

45
00:02:02,042 --> 00:02:08,036
Asking where someone lives is a way to try to find something you have in common with the person you're talking to

46
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:11,066
so if you're familiar with the area the other person lives in, 

47
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,032
make some comments about it! 

48
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,001
"That's a really nice area", 

49
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,011
or "The park there is really pretty". 

50
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,011
Anything is fine

51
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:23,009
as long as you don't say anything negative that could be taken as offensive,

52
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,002
like "That area has a high crime rate", 

53
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:29,036
or "I hear that area's really dangerous"...!

54
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,500
Do you know how to ask which school someone goes to?
