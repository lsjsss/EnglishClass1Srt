Let's look at our question again: How are you?

Here's a tip! 
这里有一个提示！

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,500
Even though these answers mean the same thing as "I'm fine",
尽管这些回答的意思与“我很好”相同，
50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,200
you can't answer "How's it going?" with "I'm fine."
但你不能用“我很好”回答“最近怎么样？”

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
It will sound a bit strange.

If you're not feeling good, you can say:

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Be careful:
要小心：

61
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,000
If you say one of these,
如果你说了其中一个，

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,900
the other person will usually ask,

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,200
"Why, what's wrong?" to be polite.

Then, you will have to explain!

Another casual, but very common version of "How are you?" is "What's up?"
另一种随意但非常常见的“你好吗？”的说法是“最近怎么样？”

(slow) Nothing much!

72

This means you're free and able to chat.
这意味着你有空聊天。

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,300
Since "What's up" is just another way of saying "Hello", 
由于“最近怎么样”只是说“你好”的另一种方式，你也可以用

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,600
you can also reply with: "Hey!" or "Hi!"
“嘿！”或“你好！”

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,100
Now it's time for Alisha's Advice!

A lot of the time,
很多时候，

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,300
when we ask questions that mean "how are you?" in English, 
当我们用英语问类似“你好吗？”的问题时，

77
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,100
we're not actually asking about the other person's health

78
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
we're only asking to be polite!

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You should think of these kinds of questions as another way of saying "Hello"

a way for the conversation to get started
是对话开始的一种方式

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
instead of actual literal questions.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In fact, when someone asks you "what's up?"
事实上，当有人问你“最近怎么样？”时，

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you don't even have to answer!

Just say "What's up?" in reply.
只需要回答“最近怎么样？”即可。

85

Do you know the difference between "What do you do?" and "What are you doing?" 
现在，你知道“你是做什么的？”和“你在做什么？”之间的区别吗？

86
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,200
It's a little tricky,
这有点棘手，

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
but we'll explain it simply in the next English in 3 Minutes lesson!
但我们将在下一个“三分钟英语问题”课程中简单解释！

88
