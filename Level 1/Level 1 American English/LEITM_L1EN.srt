00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:013,166
Welcome to EnglishClass101.com's "English in Three Minutes".

2
00:00:013,166 --> 00:00:18,054
The fastest, easiest, and most fun way to learn English.

3
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,365
Hi, how's it going?

4
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,368
I'm Alisha. Nice to meet you!

5
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:25,000
In this series, 

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,825
we're going to learn some easy ways to ask and answer common questions in English. 

7
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:35,000
It's really useful, and it only takes three minutes!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,505
In this lesson,

9
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:44,370
you're going to learn new, more common ways to ask and answer the question: "How are you?" in English.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,165
You've probably learned "How are you?" and "I'm fine" in textbooks before,

11
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:52,791
but in the United States,

12
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:57,769
people will usually ask this question and answer it in a different way.

13
00:00:58,196 --> 00:00:59,392
First,

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
let's review.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,400
If someone says:

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,278 
"How are you?"

17
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,484
You can say:

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,250
"I'm fine."

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,300
(slow) I'm fine.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,500
Here are some other ways to answer:

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,250
"Pretty good."

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,250
This means about the same thing as "I'm fine".

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
(slow) Pretty good.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,300
We also have:

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,500
"Not bad."

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,700
You can use this if you are feeling just okay, or so-so.

27
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
(slow) Not bad.

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's look at our question again: How are you?

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,500
This is the most well-known way of asking how someone is.

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,200
You could use it when you want to be polite.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,700
But now,

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,700
let's look at some different ways to ask how someone is.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,000
These ways are more casual, and much more common.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,400
First:

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey, how's it going?

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,000
You can answer this in many ways.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,900
If you're feeling good, you can say:

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,500
"Good."

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,400
(slow) Good.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
"Pretty good."

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,900
(slow) Pretty good.

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,400
"Not bad."

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,300
(slow) Not bad.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Once more:

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
"Good."

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,700
"Pretty good."

47
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,100
"Not bad."

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,500
Here's a tip! 

49
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,500
Even though these answers mean the same thing as "I'm fine",

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,200
you can't answer "How's it going?" with "I'm fine."

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
It will sound a bit strange.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,500
If you're not feeling good, you can say:

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,900
"Not so good"

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,100
(slow) Not so good

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,800
"Not great"

56
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
(slow) Not great.

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,500
or,

58
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,000
"Not so well".

59
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,200
(slow) Not so well.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,000
Be careful:

61
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,000
If you say one of these,

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,900
the other person will usually ask,

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,200
"Why, what's wrong?" to be polite.

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Then, you will have to explain!

65
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:04,000
Another casual, but very common version of "How are you?" is "What's up?"

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
To reply, use a cheerful voice as you say:

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
"Not much!"

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,400
(slow) Not Much

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,300
or

70
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,500
"Nothing much!"

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,200
(slow) Nothing much!

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
This means you're free and able to chat.

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,300
Since "What's up" is just another way of saying "Hello", 

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,600
you can also reply with: "Hey!" or "Hi!"

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,100
Now it's time for Alisha's Advice!

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,700
A lot of the time,

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,300
when we ask questions that mean "how are you?" in English, 

77
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,100
we're not actually asking about the other person's health

78
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
we're only asking to be polite!

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You should think of these questions as another way of saying "Hello"

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
a way for the conversation to get started

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,500
instead of actual literal questions.

82
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,000
In fact, when someone asks you "what's up?"

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you don't even have to answer! 

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Just say "What's up?" in reply.

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,400
Do you know the difference between "What do you do?" and "What are you doing?" 

86
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,200
It's a little tricky,

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,400
but we'll explain it simply in the next English in 3 Minutes lesson!

88
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
See you next time!
